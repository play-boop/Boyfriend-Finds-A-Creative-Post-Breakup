					Meet Tom Slater - A stand up guy who came up and never expected to see what he saw. Rather than losing his cool, he took it upon himself to handle the situation. 
				</p>
				<p><h3>Tom told our reporter</h3></p>
				<p>
					“The past few months were tough to say the least. I spent most of my time at work with little spare time for the better things in life. I was living with my girlfriend who had just lost her job, so I was putting in overtime to cover both of us. I was providing for both of us”
				</p>
				<p>Tom was in love with his girlfriend and was even considering popping the big question.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately for him, her feelings were not mutual.</p>
				<p>“It was in the middle of the week and i had move my work shifts around in order to get some time off. I thought to myself, with all this work, I should not forget that the whole reason I’m doing it is for our relationship. So, I planned a quiet night in watching TV and eating pizza”</p>
				<p><h3>Unbeknownst to me, she had already made plans….</h3></p>
				<p>As Tom walked through the door, he saw a pair of shoes lying in the main hallway towards their bedroom.</p>
				<p>Someone else was in his house.</p>
				<p>Not sure what to make of it, he immediately remembered that his girlfriend hadn’t told him of anyone coming over. He started to worry.</p>
				<p>“Who was in our home? Maybe it was just a friend of hers passing by for a coffee? But why would they take off their shoes?”</p>
				<p>He checked the whole house to see if anyone was there. The only room he had left last, was his bedroom….</p>
				<p>As Tom opened the door, his worst nightmare unravelled.</p>
				<p>She was in bed fast asleep, and next to her, was some guy.… </p>
				<p><h3>Putting two and two together, it all started to make sense….</h3></p>
				<p>Her behaviour was peculiar more recently. She seemed distant, like she was hiding something.</p>
				<p>She was on the phone until late hours in the morning in the other room, and constantly texting which was very unusual for her. She was clearly going behind his back the entire time. </p>
				<p>“I wondered if he had been the only one…. How long had this been going on for? Strong emotions of rage started to unfoil”</p>
				<p>He tried to remain calm, but his mind was going through a rollercoaster of mixed emotions.</p>
				<p><h3>Then an idea popped into his head!</h3></p>
				<p>“I just grabbed my phone and started snapping pictures for evidence. I even took a selfie with them. They were both so fast asleep, the flash didn’t make them flinch, not even a little”</p>
				<p>As soon as he was done, he got out of there and went to a friend’s place. He was both giggly and upset from the whole ordeal.</p>
				<p>That's when he shared what he captured….</p>
				<p>“I wanted everyone to know the truth I even threw in a caption: “Go to sleep and count your sheep, just don’t count on me anymore!”</p>
				<p><h3>What happened next was even more surprising!</h3></p>
				<p>People from around the world started to share and comment, congratulating him for staying cool and acting like a real man!</p>
				<p>Was he right in doing what he did? People seemed to think so. He was told that others would have done much worse.</p>
				<p><h3>The Upside Of Things</h3></p>
				<p>It was thanks to the support he received on Social Media, that he was actually able to move on from the experience.</p>
				<p>“The internet was really supportive of me and helped me through the entire ordeal. I just wasn’t sure if I would find anyone again.”</p>
				<p>Sure enough, after a month went by, he met someone at a party and asked her out. She had gone through the same ordeal and they had a lot in common.</p>
				<p>The went for dinner a couple of times, and more recently, they’ve gone steady.</p>
				<p>Hopefully Tom will have more luck the second time round.</p>
